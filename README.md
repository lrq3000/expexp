Small explorable explanations drafts, using reactve javascript frameworks such as Curvenote.

List of drafts:
* [Basic example sum calculator](./iooxa-example-sum.html)
* [Basic example sum calculator - with input fields but no reactive variables (limits the propagation of the recalculation, not all fields get updated, and the code gets messy fast!)](./iooxa-example-sum-input.html)
* [Basic example sum calculator - using reactive variables (most complete example, very concise and natural code)](./curvenote-example-sum-reactive-variables.html)
* [A calculator for cryptocurrency risk ratio - shows how to use more complex javascript calls (to fetch exchange rates)](./cryptoriskcalc.html)

All of these scripts are self-contained, they can be downloaded and used offline (as long as you also download curvenote-article package and css).

There are much more advanced examples online in the creator's documentation to learn how to use [curvenote](https://curvenote.dev) reactive [components](https://github.com/curvenote/article).

There is also an extension of this concept now brewing in the new [MyST](https://mystmd.org/) document standard proposition to extend Markdown and Jupyter notebooks to include all the components required to write dynamic documents including scientific articles.
